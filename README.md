# Heroku app for Volcano Prediction

This repository contains Streamlit based app for predicting the time to eruption of volcano from its seismic behaviour.
The model behind this app is trained on a data provided by INGV through the means of Kaggle Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-volcanic-eruptions-ingv-oe).

The file that is to be uploaded, should be similar as the segment files provided in kaggle.
To know more please check : (https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-volcanic-eruptions-ingv-oe/data)

### Instructions:
* all the files expect the files in dev directory constitute the deployed app
* dev directory contains two things:
  * a ipynb file - containing the methodology and code for the model development
  * zip folder - containing sample test files that can be used to inpect the deployed app
