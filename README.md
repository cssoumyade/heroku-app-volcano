# Heroku app for Volcano Prediction

This repository contains Streamlit based app for predicting the time to eruption of volcano from its seismic behaviour.
The model behind this app is trained on a data provided by INGV through the means of Kaggle Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-volcanic-eruptions-ingv-oe).

The file that is to be uploaded, should be similar as the segment files provided in kaggle.
